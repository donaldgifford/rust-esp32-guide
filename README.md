# Rust ESP32 Development Guide

A hands-on guide for experienced developers transitioning from high-level languages to embedded Rust development on ESP32 microcontrollers.

## About This Guide

This guide is designed for senior developers with strong backgrounds in Go, Linux, cloud infrastructure, and networking who want to explore systems programming and embedded development. You'll learn Rust fundamentals through the lens of embedded development, culminating in two practical projects: a Home Assistant sensor integration and a Prometheus metrics exporter.

**Target Hardware:**

- ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1 (RISC-V architecture, WiFi 6, BLE 5)
- ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 (Xtensa architecture, WiFi, BLE, USB OTG)

**Development Environment:** ARM-based Mac (M1/M2/M3)

**Time Estimate:** 15-20 hours for complete guide
